#  Fake News Detection System

This is a simple Machine Learning project built to practice **Logistic Regression** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal is to classify news articles as either **Real** or **Fake** based on their text content.

##  Features
* **Machine Learning:** Uses a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.
* **Text Processing:** Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text data into numbers.
* **Web Interface:** A simple and clean UI built with HTML and CSS to test news articles in real-time.
* **Backend:** Flask is used to connect the model with the frontend.

##  Dataset
The model is trained on a popular Kaggle dataset containing thousands of labeled real and fake news articles.

##  Tech Stack
* **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
* **Flask** (Backend API)
* **HTML/CSS** (Frontend)

##  What I Learned
* How to preprocess text data (cleaning, lowercase, etc.).
* Implementing Logistic Regression for text classification.
* How to connect a Machine Learning model to a web interface.
